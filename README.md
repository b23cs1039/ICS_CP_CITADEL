Hello!

These are the instructions you have to follow while executing our code for matrix operations.

1. Follow the steps displayed on the output terminal to perform the operations. Please enter a valid operation key.
2. After selecting the operation, Enter the dimensions of the matrices as asked on the output terminal.
3. NOTE: In multiplication kindly follow the condition in entering the dimensions of the matrices.
4. Enter the elements of matrices (only integers) following the instructions given on the screen.
5. Then the code will show you the results of your operations if all your actions satisfy the matrix conditions.
6. Otherwise the program will give you the comments if your operations are not correct or mistaken.
7. Then follow the instructions to either continue the operations or to stop there.
8. NOTE: In inverse operations the elements in the resultant inverse matrix are in decimal form and are rounded to two decimal places.

Sample program 1:


Which operation of matrices do you want to perform?

Enter 1 if you want to add two matrices.

Enter 2 if you want to subtract two matrices

Enter 3 if you want to multiply two matrices.

Enter 4 if you want to find trace of a square matrix.

Enter 5 if you want to find transpose of a matrix.

Enter 6 if you want to find determinant of a square matrix.

Enter 7 if you want to find cofactor matrix of a square matrix.

Enter 8 if you want to find adjoint matrix of a square matrix.

Enter 9 if you want to find inverse matrix of a square matrix.

Enter 10 if you want to multiply a matrix with an integer.

1

Enter the number of rows and columns of the matrices you want to add, separated by spaces: 3 4

Enter the elements of the first matrix such that each element in a row is separated by spaces and each row is in separate line.

1 2 2 1

2 4 1 1

1 1 2 2

Enter the elements of the second matrix such that each element in a row is separated by spaces and each row is in separate line.

1 1 3 2

3 2 2 3

4 0 1 1

The resultant addition matrix is

2 3 5 3

5 6 3 4

5 1 3 3

Do you want to perform another operation?

Enter 1 if you want to perform another operation.

Enter 0 if you want to exit.

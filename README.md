Hello!

These are the instructions you have to follow while executing our code for matrix operations.

1. Follow the steps displayed on the output terminal to perform the operations. Please enter a valid operation key.
2. After selecting the operation, Enter the dimensions of the matrices as asked on the output terminal.
3. NOTE: In multiplication kindly follow the condition in entering the dimensions of the matrices.
4. Enter the elements of matrices (only integers) following the instructions given on the screen.
5. Then the code will show you the results of your operations if all your actions satisfy the matrix conditions.
6. Otherwise the program will give you the comments if your operations are not correct or mistaken.
7. Then follow the instructions to either continue the operations or to stop there.
8. NOTE: In inverse operations the elements in the resultant inverse matrix are in decimal form and are rounded to two decimal places.
